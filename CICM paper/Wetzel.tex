\begin{abstract}
In 1964, Paul Erd\H{o}s published a paper~\cite{erdos-interpolation} settling a question about function spaces that he had seen in a problem book.
Erd\H{o}s proved that the answer was yes if and only if the continuum hypothesis failed.
Therefore, an innocent-looking question turned out to be undecidable from the axioms of ZFC\@.
The formalisation of these proofs in Isabelle/HOL demonstrate the combination of complex analysis and set theory, and in particular how the Isabelle/HOL framework for ZFC is integrated with its basis in higher-order logic.

\section{Introduction}

This story~\cite{garcia-wetzels-problem} expresses the richness of mathematics.
It seemed that Erd\H{o}s found the following question in a problem book belonging to the mathematics department of Ann Arbor University:
\begin{quote}
Suppose that $F$ is a family of analytic functions on $\mathbb{C}$ such that for each $z$ the set $\{f (z)\mid f\in F\}$ is countable. (Call this \emph{property $P_0$}.) Then is the family $F$ itself countable?
\end{quote}
This question apparently arose naturally in the PhD work of John E. Wetzel, originally in connection with spaces of harmonic functions.
Ellie was able to show that if the continuum hypothesis failed, every family satisfying $P_0$ had to be countable; but if the hypothesis held, he showed how to create an uncountable family satisfying $P_0$ by a transfinite construction.

The celebrated continuum hypothesis (CH), which was number one on Hilbert's list of fundamental unsolved problems, asks whether there exists a cardinality between that of the natural numbers, namely $\aleph_0$, and that of the real numbers, namely $\frak{c}$.
Since the next cardinal after $\aleph_0$ is denoted $\aleph_1$, while the cardinality of the continuum is known to equal $2^{\aleph_0}$,  CH can be written symbolically as $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1$.
It's a fundamental question because the notion of a countable set is straightforward (simply, any set that can be enumerated). 
The proof that the real numbers cannot be enumerated is a simple diagonalisation: Cantor's theorem.
There is no obvious way to construct a set lying in between, neither enumerable nor equivalent in cardinality to the reals.
Cantor's conjecture that no such set existed was shown to be consistent with the axioms of set theory by GÃ¶del and independent from them by Cohen.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.



\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z

Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).


\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
