\begin{abstract}
In 1964, Paul Erd\H{o}s published a paper~\cite{erdos-interpolation} settling a question about function spaces that he had seen in a problem book.
Erd\H{o}s proved that the answer was yes if and only if the continuum hypothesis failed.
Therefore, an innocent-looking question turned out to be undecidable from the axioms of ZFC\@.
The formalisation of these proofs in Isabelle/HOL demonstrate the combination of complex analysis and set theory, and in particular how the Isabelle/HOL framework for ZFC is integrated with its basis in higher-order logic.

\section{Introduction}

This story~\cite{garcia-wetzels-problem} expresses the richness of mathematics.
It seemed that Erd\H{o}s found the following question in a problem book belonging to the mathematics department of Ann Arbor University:
\begin{quote}
Suppose that $F$ is a family of analytic functions on $\mathbb{C}$ such that for each $z$ the set $\{f (z)\mid f\in F\}$ is countable. (Call this \emph{property $P_0$}.) Then is the family $F$ itself countable?
\end{quote}
This question apparently arose naturally in the PhD work of John E. Wetzel, originally in connection with spaces of harmonic functions.
Erd\H{o}s was able to show that if the continuum hypothesis failed, every family satisfying $P_0$ had to be countable; but if the hypothesis held, he showed how to create an uncountable family satisfying $P_0$ by a transfinite construction.

Cantor's celebrated continuum hypothesis (CH), number one on Hilbert's list of fundamental questions, asks whether there exists a cardinality between that of the natural numbers, namely $\aleph_0$, and that of the real numbers, namely~$\frak{c}$.
Since the next cardinal after $\aleph_0$ is denoted $\aleph_1$ and the cardinality of the continuum is known to equal $2^{\aleph_0}$,  CH can be written symbolically as $\aleph_1 = 2^{\aleph_0}$.
It's fundamental because the notion of a countable set is straightforward, as is the proof by diagonalisation that the real numbers cannot be enumerated (Cantor's theorem).
CH asserts that no set exists of intermediate size between the natural numbers and the reals.
It was shown to be consistent with the axioms of set theory by Gödel and independent from them by Cohen.

I have formalised Gödel's model for the former result, the constructible sets~\cite{paulson-consistency}, while
Gunther et al.\ \cite{Independence_CH-AFP} have formalised model constructions both to confirm and refute CH using forcing.
These formalisation tasks were done using Isabelle/ZF, the instance of Isabelle for first-order logic and set theory.
However, Isabelle/HOL (the instance of Isabelle for higher-order logic) is much better developed than Isabelle/ZF;
in particular, the Wetzel problem requires its complex analysis library. So this paper is an exploration of how to tackle a problem that combines the worlds of analysis and set theory, including such mysteries as transfinite cardinals and recursion up to uncountable ordinals.
