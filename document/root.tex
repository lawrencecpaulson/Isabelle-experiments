\title{Young's Inequality for Increasing Functions}
\author{Lawrence C. Paulson}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Young's inequality is formalised following the development by Cunningham and Grossman~\cite{cunningham-youngs}.
Their idea is to make the informal geometric proof rigorous by reasoning about step functions.
The lack of the Riemann integral makes the development longer than necessary, but the argument is reproduced faithfully.
